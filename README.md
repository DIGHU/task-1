# DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK #

As part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**, I developed a Java-based **File Operations Application** to demonstrate the use of Java's file handling capabilities. This project was focused on three main operations: writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying the contents of a file.

The application allows users to input text through the console, which is then written into a file using `BufferedWriter`. This was helpful in understanding how file creation and writing operations work in Java. If the file already exists, the content is overwritten.

After writing, the program reads the content of the file using `BufferedReader` and displays it line by line on the console. This part of the project helped me learn how to access stored data, handle line-based reading, and manage exceptions related to file input.

The third functionality was modifying the content of the file. The user can provide a word to replace and its new replacement word. The program reads the original content, replaces the specified word using string operations, and then writes the updated content back to the same file.

Throughout this task, I used various Java I/O classes such as `FileWriter`, `FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and Scanner. I also practiced exception handling to ensure that the program doesnâ€™t crash due to file access errors.

This project improved my Java coding skills and gave me real-world experience with file operations. I now understand how to manage file streams, ensure resource safety using try-with-resources, and manipulate text-based data effectively.

Overall, this was a useful and educational task that enhanced my understanding of file handling in Java.
